# Java_Chess
This is my attempt at making a chess game in Java



In order to play you will need to have Java installed on your computer, if you have linux, then you are good to go. If you have Windows or Mac on the other hand you should go and install Java. You will also need to have git. If you are on linux, then once again you are in luck, if not then please go install it and then come back.

After you've done that head into your terminal, then type the following
```Shell
git clone https://github.com/MakusFrig/Java_Chess/
```

This will clone this repository and all the files in it. From here you are goin to "cd" into the directory

```Shell
cd Java_Chess
```

Once here all you have to do is compile the files with this simple command:

```Shell
javac *.java
```

Once they are all compiled then you can run the application with:

```Shell
java Main
```

Voila, after only four lines of code you have succesfully installed Java_Chess and are running it. Have fun !
